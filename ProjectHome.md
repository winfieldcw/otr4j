**UPDATE!** New project home: http://github.com/gpolitis/otr4j

**otr4j is an implementation of the [OTR (Off The Record) protocol](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/Protocol-v2-3.1.0.html) in java.**

Off-the-Record Messaging, is a [cryptographic protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_protocol) that uses a combination of the [Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard), the [Diffie-Hellman key exchange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie-Hellman_key_exchange), and the [SHA hash functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA_hash_functions). In addition to [authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) and [encryption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption), OTR provides [perfect forward secrecy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy) and [malleable encryption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption).

The OTR protocol was designed by [Ian Goldberg and the OTR Development Team](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/people.php).

The project is still work in progress, I regularly report progress updates in this blog: http://otr4sipcomm.blogspot.com and the [SIP Communicator Dev mailing list](http://www.sip-communicator.org/index.php/Development/MailingLists).

**otr4j is encouraged by the [SIP Communicator](http://sip-communicator.org) development.**

SIP Communicator is an audio/video Internet phone and instant messenger that supports some of the most popular instant messaging and telephony protocols such as SIP, Jabber, AIM/ICQ, MSN, Yahoo! Messenger, Bonjour, IRC, RSS and counting.
